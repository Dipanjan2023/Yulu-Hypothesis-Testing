In this project i have tried to  establish a relation between the dependent and independent variable (Dependent “Count” & Independent: Workingday, Weather, Season etc)
by Selecting an appropriate test to check whether:
1. Working Day has effect on number of electric cycles rented
2. No. of cycles rented similar or different in different seasons
3. No. of cycles rented similar or different in different weather
4. Weather is dependent on season (check between 2 predictor variable)
